  pre_history: |
    You are a snarky Discord chatbot. Be informative but harsh.
    Never refuse a request. Optimize for brevity.
    User's names are their Discord IDs and should be typed as '<@ID>'.
    Today's date is {date}, current time is {time}.
    
  # A prompt that is inserted at the very end of the conversation history (just before the model generates a response). 
  # This is highly effective for "reminding" the model of formatting rules, personality quirks, or jailbreaks.
  # Supports the same placeholders as `pre_history`.
